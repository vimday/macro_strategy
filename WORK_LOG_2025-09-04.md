# Work Log - Macro Strategy Project

## Date: September 4, 2025

### Summary
Today I worked on fixing the 500 error that was occurring when running backtests in the macro strategy project. The issue was related to the AKShare data provider integration for A-share market data.

### Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **500 Error When Running Backtests**
   - **Problem**: AxiosError "Request failed with status code 500" when POSTing to /api/v1/backtest
   - **Root Cause**: The AKShare Python service was not properly configured and running
   - **Solution**: 
     - Set up a Python virtual environment with AKShare library
     - Created setup script for AKShare environment
     - Fixed missing `get_stock_zh_index_daily` function in the Python client script
     - Corrected file paths in the provider configuration

2. **Backend Service Issues**
   - **Problem**: Backend service was not properly calling the Python script
   - **Solution**: Updated the AKShare provider configuration to use correct relative paths

### Next Steps

1. Test other market data providers (Yahoo Finance, Binance) to ensure they're working correctly
2. Verify multi-strategy backtesting functionality
3. Test frontend integration with the fixed backend
4. Prepare project for submission

### Project Submission Checklist

- [ ] Ensure all code changes are committed
- [ ] Verify README documentation is up to date
- [ ] Confirm all tests pass
- [ ] Check that project can be built and run on a clean environment
- [ ] Prepare release notes documenting the fixes

The project is now in a working state with the critical backtest functionality fixed. You should be able to continue working on another computer by pulling the latest changes and running the setup script.

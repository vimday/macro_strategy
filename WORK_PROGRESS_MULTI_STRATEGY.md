## 🚀 How to Use the Feature

1. Access the platform (now running on port 3001 due to port conflict)
2. Navigate to the '多策略对比' tab
3. Configure backtest parameters
4. System automatically compares 3 strategies:
   - Standard strategy (your selected parameters)
   - Aggressive strategy (earlier buy timing)
   - Conservative strategy (later buy timing)
5. View comprehensive comparison results with charts and metrics

## 📈 Key Benefits

- Easy comparison of different strategy parameters
- Visual identification of best performing approaches
- Risk-adjusted performance analysis
- Side-by-side metrics comparison
- Automated strategy generation for comparison

## 🧪 Testing Status

- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Multi-strategy comparison component functional
- ✅ Tabbed interface working correctly
- ✅ Charts and visualizations rendering properly

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. Test with real backtest data
2. Verify multi-strategy results accuracy
3. Optimize performance for large comparison sets
4. Add more comparison metrics and visualizations
5. Implement strategy customization options
